## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I am an Electronics Engineer with solid experience in programming microcontrollers, microprocessors, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). I have worked in the design and manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and power circuit design. Additionally, I have extensive experience in data engineering, including database design, creation and maintenance of ETL processes for large-scale datasets, and working with tools such as Python, SQL, Impala and Sybase DB services. I am also eager to keep learning and exploring new technologies as I grow in my career.
